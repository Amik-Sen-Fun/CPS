## Final Project Paper Notes

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are modernizing our infrastructures by optimizing the use of resources in power grids, transportation systems, buildings, and other critical infrastructures.To achieve their goal, CPS uses sensors to collect large-scale, fine-grained data from a variety of systems including human activities, posing serious privacy concerns.

 To protect the privacy of people whose activities are captured by CPS, we can apply tools developed for general in- formation technology problems, like differential privacy. However, their direct application without leveraging the unique CPS setting will cause unnecessary negative impacts to the utility of CPS, and in some cases, it can lead to potentially unsafe operating conditions. Due to the physical system dynamics, feedback control, and inherent noise, different tools from control theory can be extended to design novel privacy- enhancing technologies.

In particular, we focus on stochastic control systems and on how the inherent uncertainties of the system (e.g., sensor noise, and disturbances) can be used to ensure certain levels of privacy. 

In particular, we introduce a methodology to inject the minimum amount of differential-privacy noise to ensure our desired levels of privacy by leveraging the noise already available in the system.
